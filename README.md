# Inception

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.
# Docker

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment

- display information about your Docker environment:

        docker info
- the version of Docker:

        docker --version

# Docker containers

After you run a docker image, it creates a docker container. All the applications and their environment run inside this container. You can use Docker API or CLI to start, stop, delete a docker container.

- Below is a sample command to run a ubuntu docker container:
        
        docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
        
- Showing their container IDs, names, status:
        
        docker container ls
        docker container ls -aq
        docker container ls -a
- stop a running container:
        
        docker container stop id or name 
-  Remove one or more containers:
       
        docker container rm -f id or name
        docker container prune
- Run a command in a running container:
        
        docker exec -it id or name bash
- inspect a Docker container:

        docker container inspect id
- Restart one or more running containers:

        $ docker container restart id or name
 
- docker container logs:

        $ docker container logs id or name 
   
 # Volumes
 
The persisting data generated by docker and used by Docker containers are stored in Volumes.

- Create a volume:

        docker volume create --name my-volume
        docker volume create --name my-volume --driver local

- List volumes:
        
        docker volume ls
        
        
- Display detailed information about a volume:

        docker volume inspect my-volume

- Remove one or more volumes

        docker volume rm -f my-volume another-volume

- Remove all unused volumes:

        docker volume prune

- Attach a volume to a container:

        docker run -d --name my-container -v my-volume:/app/data alpine

- Detach a volume from a container:
        
        docker stop my-container && docker rm my-container
      
  # Networks
  1 - Bridge: It is the default network driver for a container. You use this network when your application is running on standalone containers, i.e. multiple containers communicating with same docker host.
  
  2 - Host: This driver removes the network isolation between docker containers and docker host. It is used when you don’t need any network isolation between host and container.
  
  3 - Overlay: This network enables swarm services to communicate with each other. It is used when the containers are running on different Docker hosts or when swarm services are formed by multiple applications.
  
  4 - None: This driver disables all the networking.
  
  5 - macvlan: This driver assigns mac address to containers to make them look like physical devices. The traffic is routed between containers through their mac addresses. This network is used when you want the containers to look like a physical device, for example, while migrating a VM setup.
Docker networking is a passage through which all the isolated container communicate. There are mainly five network drivers in docker:

- Create a new network:

          docker network create my-network
- Inspect a network:

          docker network inspect my-network
- Delete a network:

          docker network rm my-network
- Connect a container to a network:

          docker network connect my-network my-container
- Disconnect a container from a network:
          
          docker network disconnect my-network my-container

# Docker images

A read-only template for creating containers. An image contains the installations of an application instance or an instance group with its software and dependencies, and the process to run when the container is launched. 

- list the images on your system:

            docker image ls
- docker image build -t my-image

            docker image build -t my-image .
- pull an image from a registry:

            docker image pull ubuntu
- push an image to a registry:

            docker image push my-image
- remove an image:

            docker image rm -f my-image
- inspect an image:

            docker image inspect my-image
- docker image inspect my-image

            docker image inspect my-image

# DockerFile

Every Docker container starts with a simple text file containing instructions for how to build the Docker container image. DockerFile automates the process of Docker image creation. It’s essentially a list of command-line interface (CLI) instructions that Docker Engine will run in order to assemble the image. The list of Docker commands is huge, but standardized: Docker operations work the same regardless of contents, infrastructure, or other environment variables.

# Docker client

Primary user interface for the Docker daemon. It accepts commands from the user and communicates with the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon and client can run on the same or separate systems. The Docker client and daemon communicate via sockets or through RESTful APIs.

# Docker daemon

Builds, runs, and manages Docker containers on a host machine.
# Docker registries
Repositories of images for users to upload or download. Registries can be public or private. The public Docker registry is called the Docker Hub.
# Docker Architecture
